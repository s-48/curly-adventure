1) Frances Andrews, Nil Ceylan, Shawn Spicer, CS4318

2) Meeting Plans
We plan to meet in person after class for an hour or more. Other meetings will be scheduled as time allows. We each aim to work on the project for about five to seven hours a week. Additionally, we meet online via Discord for further collaboration.
